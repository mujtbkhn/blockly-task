# Vehicle Movement on Map Web Application

This web application allows users to visualize vehicle movement on a map using Leaflet. Users can click on the map to set a starting point and click again to set a destination. The app calculates the shortest route between the two points, utilizing libraries like Leaflet, and animates a car marker along the route. Additional features include resetting the route and adjusting the animation speed.

## Features

- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Click to set the starting point and destination on the map, and the shortest route is calculated.
- **Animated Car Movement**: A car marker animates along the selected route, with adjustable speed.
- **Route Reset**: Easily reset the route and select new points to calculate a different path.
- **Speed Adjustment**: Change the speed of the car animation along the route.

## Tech Stack

- **React (Vite)**: Frontend framework for building the application.
- **Leaflet**: For map integration and visualization.
- **React Leaflet**: React components for Leaflet maps.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.
